# Cricket-Team-Selection-Data-Analysis--Python-and-Power-Bi
Purpose of this project is to select top 11 cricketer out of all the teams around the world by using Python and Power-BI.


**-- Data Ingesting Process:**
1) Ingested files into jupyter Notebook while using **read_json** file command. 
2) Analyzed the whole data as I had :
3) Match_summary, Match-Player, Batting_summary, and Bowling_summary dataset from which I have to find the top 11.


**-- Data Cleaning Process:**
1) Using **Lambda** function added a new column using the commands. 
2) Made a **dictionary** for the data while combining the two countries matches Eg: Nambia Vs Sri Lanka , etc.....
3) Removed the unwanted texts from the dataset. 


**-- Power-BI used for data visualization and data processing:**
1) Through Power-BI first made a Data modeling for how the selection will proceed and how can each dataset is matchhing to others. 
2) Then while using the client's requirements I select the top hitters, top bowlers and top mid over players and so on......
3) That's how I found out the conclusion and visualized the **top 11 cricketer**.
